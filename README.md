A cool discord bot. Get **discord** module using pip. 

In **Token**, enter the token of your own bot cuz I ain't giving mine ;) 

The prefix is **:p** but you can change it to whatever you want.

You can roast someone and even toss a coin. (Lame but that's why you can modify it and add more features too) ;)

Plus, you can even send stickers using it. (If the links don't work, save the stickers and make your own links)
